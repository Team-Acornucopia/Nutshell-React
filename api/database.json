It's the fourth game Lee has missed this season with nagging hamstring injuries, and it won't be his last, his absence predicted to stretch upwards of six weeks. If that holds firm, he'll end up having been sidelined nine of 16 regular season games, a keen reminder of why the Cowboys selected Vander Esch with the 19th-overall pick in the first place.",

Despite the changes and the modern Pokémon Go-influenced touches, the magic of Pokémon persists in Let’s Go, just by virtue of it being Pokémon.",

When their employees were polled about areas for manager improvement, they overwhelmingly cited leadership and emotional intelligence. In other words, managers wanted to improve their instrumental skills and figure out better ways of getting things done. Employees wanted managers to improve their expressive skills: how they interacted in a team context.",
